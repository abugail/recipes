**Basic Pizza Dough**

- 1 tablespoon dry yeast  
- 1 teaspoon caster (superfine) sugar  
- 1 cup (250 ml) lukewarm water  
- 2½ cups (375 g) OO flour *(see tips + tricks, page 152)*  
- 1 teaspoon sea salt flakes  
- 1 tablespoon olive oil  

**Method:**

1. Place the yeast, sugar, and water in a bowl and mix to combine.  
2. Set aside in a warm place for 5 minutes or until bubbles appear on the surface (this means the yeast is activated).  
3. Place the flour, salt, and olive oil in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the yeast mixture and mix together with well-floured hands to form a dough.  
4. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface for 3–4 minutes or until smooth and elastic.  
5. Divide the dough into equal-size balls *(see individual recipes for amounts)*.  
6. Place on a lightly floured tray under a clean, damp cloth and set aside in a warm place for 30 minutes or until the balls have doubled in size.  
7. Press each dough ball into a round and roll out on a lightly floured surface to the desired size as per recipe instructions.

*Note: You can make pizzas in different shapes and sizes with this basic dough. The recipe will make two 30 cm round pizzas or up to twelve 15 cm round mini pizzas. Divide the dough into equal-size balls and roll out to your desired shape.*
