### Description

In this fragrant dish bursting with delicate flavours, we're marrying dukkah-spiced chicken breasts with fluffy bulgur and crunchy sumac-seasoned radishes. These bright flavours are served over a generous spoonful of labneh, a thick Lebanese fresh cheese made from drained yogurt, then drizzled with bold mint and green onion vinaigrette.

### Ingredients

* 2 Chicken breasts                   
* 150g Radishes
* 1 Bunch of mint  
* 1 Lemon          
* 2 Scallions      
* 78g Bulgur
* 3g Sumac
* 60 mL Labneh
* 10g Dukkah (white sesame seeds, roast chickpeas, coriande cumin, salt, black spearmint)


### Cooking Instructions

1. In a medium pot, combine the bulgur, 1 cup of water (double for 4 portions) and a big pinch of salt; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and let simmer, 6 to 8 minutes, until the bulgur is tender and the water is absorbed. Fluff the cooked bulgur with a fork and set aside in a warm spot.
2. While the bulgur cooks, in a medium pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high. Pat the chicken dry with paper towel; season with the sprice blend, salt and pepper. Cook, partially covered, 7 to 10 minutes per side or until cooked through.
3. While the chicken cooks, pick the mint leaves off the stems. Juice the lemon, halve the radishes. Cut off and discard the root ends of the scallions; thinly slice separating the white bottoms and green tops.
4. In a second medium pan, melt 2 tbsp of butter on medium-high. Cook, swirling the pan, 2 to 4 minutes or until light golden brown with a nutty aroma (be careful not to overcook as the butter can burn easily). Add the white bottoms of the scallions and radishes; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 3 to 4, minutes, ntil beginning to soften. Add 1/2 the lemon juice and the sumac; toss to combine.
5. While the radishes cook, in a bowl, combine the remaining lemon juice, mint (roughly chop before adding), 1/2 the green tops of the scallions and 3 tbsp of olive oil; season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. On a serving plate, spread the labneh in a large circular shape. Top with the bulgur, radishes and chicken; drivzle with as much of the herb vinaigrette as you'd like. Garnish with the remaining green tops of the scallions. Bon appetit!
