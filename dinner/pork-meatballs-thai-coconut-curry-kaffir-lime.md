### Ingredients

* 285g Ground pork
* 225g Baby bok choy
* 1 Shallot (or onion)
* 1 Lime
* 1 Sweet pepper
* 1 Bunch of Thai basil
* 2 Kaffir lime leaves
* 1 Thai chili
* 157g Jasmine rice
* 36g Mild yellow curry paste
* 165ml Coconut milk


### Cooking Instructions

1. In a medium pot, combine the rice, 1 ½ cups of water (double for 4 portions) and a big pinch of salt; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and let simmer, 14 to 16 minutes, until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff the cooked rice with a fork and set aside in a warm spot.
1. While the rice cooks, peel and mince the shallot. Core and medium dice the sweet pepper. Quarter the lime. Pick the Thai basil leaves off the stems. Cut off and discard the root ends of the bok choy; roughly chop the leaves crosswise. Cut the chili lengthwise, remove the seeds and mince the flesh (thoroughly wash your hands after this step – the pepper is spicy).
1. In a medium bowl, combine the ground pork and shallot (add the Thai chili for a spicy dish); season with S&P. Gently mix to combine. Using your hands, form the mixture into meatballs about the size of a golf ball. In a large, high-sided pan (or pot), heat a drizzle of oil on medium-high. Add the meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes, until browned on all sides. Transfer to a plate.
1. While the meatballs cook, in a large pot, heat a drizzle of oil on medium. Add the curry paste and cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, until the curry paste is toasted and fragrant. Add the sweet pepper; season with S&P. Cook, stirring frequently. 1 to 2 minutes, until beginning to soften. Add the coconut milk (shaking the can before opening), kaffir lime leaf and 1 cup of water. Simmer, stirring occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes.
1. Add the cooked meatballs and bok choy to the pot of curry. Simmer, 1 to 3 minutes, until the bok choy is wilted. Remove from the heat and take out the kaffir lime leaf. Stir in the juice of ½ the lime wedges; season with S&P to taste. Divide the finished rice and curry between your bowls. Garnish with the Thai basil (roughly chop before adding). Bon appétit!
