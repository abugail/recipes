### Ingredients

* 1 small spaghetti squash (about 3-4 pounds)
* 2 tbs unsalted butter
* 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
* 1/4 cup finely minced parsley (or basil)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
* 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese


> **Pro Tip:** Baking time really depends on how big your squash is - try to get the smallest one. Itâ€™s ready if you can pierce the squash with a paring knife with little resistance.

> You can also microwave the whole squash for 2-4 minutes (to soften enough to cut lengthwise). Place squash cut-side down on baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes until tender.

> Can make with meatballs and meat sauce or a bolognase with ground turkey as well. 

### Cooking Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375F.
2. Pierce squash a few times with sharp paring knife (to let steam escape).
3. Bake **spaghetti squash** for 60 minutes, or until a paring knife pierces easily through skin with little resistance.
4. Let squash cool for 10 minutes.
5. Cut squash in half, lengthwise. Use a fork to remove and discard the seeds.
6. Continue using fork to scrape the squash to get long, lovely strands. *If the squash seem difficult to scrape, return the squash to bake for an additional 10 minutes.*
7. Heat a large saute pan with the **butter** and **garlic** over medium-low heat.
8. When garlic becomes fragrant, add **parsley, salt** and **spaghetti squash strands**.
9. Toss well, sprinkle in the **parmesan** cheese and taste to see if you need additional salt.
10. The spaghetti squash should have a slight crunch (i.e. not mushy) - but if you like it softer, cover the pan and cook 2 more minutes.
