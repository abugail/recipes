### Description

Get your grill (or pan) ready for the most tender cut of pork! These savoury tournedos are glazed with a sweet & tangy blend of BBQ sauce, orange juice and ginger to get your taste buds in the mood for summer fun! Oven-roasted sweet potatoes join the party along with a summer slaw: thinly sliced napa cabbage, carrots and chives are sweetened with a touch of honey and balanced with just the right amount of tartness courtesy of freshly-squeezed lime juice and apple cider vinegar. Who’s left to invite to this BBQ bash? You, obviously!

### Ingredients

* 300g Pork tournedos
* 15ml Ginger paste
* 1 Lime
* 1 Bunch of chives
* 200g Carrots
* 200g Shredded Napa cabbage
* 450g Diced sweet potatoes
* 15ml Apple cider vinegar
* 14g Honey
* 45ml BBQ sauce
* 30ml Orange juice


### Cooking Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F. On a lined sheet pan, toss the sweet potatoes with a drizzle of olive oil and season with S&P. Arrange in a single, even layer and roast in the oven, flipping halfway through, 18 to 20 minutes or until lightly browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven and transfer to a serving dish.
1. While the sweet potatoes cook, juice the lime. In a bowl, combine the BBQ sauce, orange juice and ginger.
1. While the sweet potatoes continue to cook, heat your BBQ on high, making sure to oil it first (or heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan on medium-high). Pat the pork tournedos dry with paper towel; season with S&P. Grill the pork, 2 to 4 minutes per side (on all six sides), brushing them with the BBQ sauce mixture, until cooked through.
1. In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, carrots, chives (thinly slice before adding), lime juice, vinegar, honey and a drizzle of olive oil; season with S&P to taste. Toss to thoroughly combine.
1. Divide the roasted sweet potatoes, grilled tournedos (removing the butcher’s twine before serving) and slaw between your plates. Bon appétit!
