### Description

"Tonight, we add a touch of sophistication and exoticism to traditional tacos by incorporating ingredients and flavours from East Asian cuisines. Cabbage, lime and mango combine in a colourful salad while sesame, soy sauce and tomatillos make a fresh sauce. These two inspired elements are loaded into soft tortillas and topped with slices of grilled pork chops and a generous sprinkling of cotija cheese. This recipe is proof that fusion cuisine can be accessible, surprising and simply delicious!"

### Ingredients

* 285g Pork tenderloin strips
* 2 Garlic cloves
* 1 Lime
* 225g Tomatillos
* 200g Shredded red cabbage
* 1 Mango
* 30ml Soy sauce reduced in sodium
* 30ml Rice vinegar
* 15ml Sesame oil
* 56g Cotija cheese
* 8g Wheat flour tortillas

### Cooking Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Peel and julienne the mango. Remove the husks and small dice the tomatillos
1. In a medium pan, heat the sesame oil on medium-high. Add the garlic (mince before adding), tomatillos, soy sauce and ½ the vinegar. Cook, stirring occasionally and crushing the tomatillos with the back of your spoon, 5 to 6 minutes until completely softened.
1. In a large pan, heat a generous drizzle of oil on medium. Pat the pork strips dry with a paper towel; season with S&P. Add the pork to the pan and cook, 2 to 3 minutes or until cooked through and browned on all sides. Set aside in a warm spot.
1. While the pork cooks, stack the tortillas on a large piece of foil; tightly wrap the foil around the tortillas. Carefully place directly onto the oven rack and bake in the oven, 6 to 8 minutes or until heated through. Keep covered until ready to serve.
1. In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, mango, remaining vinegar and juice of the lime (halve and squeeze into the bowl); season with S&P to taste. Toss to thoroughly combine. Divide the warmed tortillas between your plates, top with the slaw, pork strips, tomatillo sauce and cheese. Serve the remaining sauce on the side. Bon appétit!
