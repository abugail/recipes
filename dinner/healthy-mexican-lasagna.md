6. Grease a deep lasagna pan and preheat the oven to 400°F. 
7. Cut the **tortillas** into 1"x1" squares. 
8. Put the **refried beans** in a bowl and mix with a little bit of water to make them easier to spread.

10. Layer in order: half of the tortilla strips, ALL the beans, half of the veggies, half the turkey, half of the sauce, half of the cheese.
