* 3 cups frozen corn
* 2 tsp chili powder
* 2 tsp cumin
* 2 cups Mexican cheese shredded
* 18-20 corn tortillas

2. Dice the peppers and onions.
3. Heat a large nonstick skillet with a little bit of olive oil over high heat.
4. Add the **onion** and **peppers**, sprinkle with **chili** and **cumin** stirring consistantly until you get a nice browning on the outside of the peppers.
5. Remove and set aside. Repeat the roasting process with the **corn**, sprinkling with **chili** and **cumin**.
6. Grease a deep lasagna pan and preheat the oven to 400°F. 
7. Cut the **tortillas** into 1"x1" squares. 
8. Put the **refried beans** in a bowl and mix with a little bit of water to make them easier to spread.
9. Spread a *little bit* of **enchilada sauce** on the bottom of the pan.
10. Layer in order: half of the tortilla strips, ALL the beans, half of the veggies, half the turkey, half of the sauce, half of the cheese.
11. Cover with the other half of the tortilla strips, veggies, turkey, sauce, and cheese.
