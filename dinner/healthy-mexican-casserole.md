### Ingredients

* 2 red bell peppers
* 2 green bell peppers
* 1 jalapeno or 2 chipotle peppers (optional - just for more kick)
* ½ red onion
* 2 cups frozen corn
* 2 teaspoons chili powder
* 2 teaspoon cumin
* salt to taste (about 1 teaspoon)
* 2 cups Mexican cheese shredded
* 18-20 corn tortillas
* 1 can refried beans
* 2 cups red enchilada sauce
* cilantro or sour cream for topping

> **Pro Tip:** Could add ground beef or ground turkey for more protein

### Cooking Instructions

1. Dice the peppers and mince the onions.
2. Heat a large nonstick skillet with a little bit of olive oil over high heat.
3. Add the **onion** and **peppers**, sprinkle with **chili** and **cumin** stirring consistantly until you get a nice browning on the outside of the peppers.
4. Remove and set aside. Repeat the roasting process with the **corn**, sprinkling with **chili** and **cumin**.
5. Sprinkle the roasted veggies with a little bit of **salt** and toss to coat.
6. Grease a 9x13 inch lasagna pan and preheat the oven to 400°F. 
7. Cut the **tortillas** into thin strips. 
8. Put the **refried beans** in a bowl and mix with a little bit of water to make them easier to spread.
9. Spread a little bit of **enchilada sauce** on the bottom of the pan.
10. Layer in order: half of the tortilla strips, ALL the beans, half of the veggies, half of the sauce, half of the cheese.
11. Cover with the other half of the tortilla strips, veggies, sauce, and cheese.
12. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is melted.
13. Serve with guacamole, fresh cilantro, or sour cream
