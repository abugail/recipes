<h3 id="description"><a class="header-link" href="#description"></a>Description</h3>
<p>In this fragrant dish bursting with delicate flavours, we&#39;re marrying dukkah-spiced chicken breasts with fluffy bulgur and crunchy sumac-seasoned radishes. These bright flavours are served over a generous spoonful of labneh, a thick Lebanese fresh cheese made from drained yogurt, then drizzled with bold mint and green onion vinaigrette.</p>

<h3 id="cooking-instructions"><a class="header-link" href="#cooking-instructions"></a>Cooking Instructions</h3>
<ol class="list">
<li>In a medium pot, combine the bulgur, 1 cup of water (double for 4 portions) and a big pinch of salt; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and let simmer, 6 to 8 minutes, until the bulgur is tender and the water is absorbed. Fluff the cooked bulgur with a fork and set aside in a warm spot.</li>
<li>While the bulgur cooks, in a medium pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high. Pat the chicken dry with paper towel; season with the sprice blend, salt and pepper. Cook, partially covered, 7 to 10 minutes per side or until cooked through.</li>
<li>While the chicken cooks, pick the mint leaves off the stems. Juice the lemon, halve the radishes. Cut off and discard the root ends of the scallions; thinly slice separating the white bottoms and green tops.</li>
<li>In a second medium pan, melt 2 tbsp of butter on medium-high. Cook, swirling the pan, 2 to 4 minutes or until light golden brown with a nutty aroma (be careful not to overcook as the butter can burn easily). Add the white bottoms of the scallions and radishes; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 3 to 4, minutes, ntil beginning to soften. Add 1/2 the lemon juice and the sumac; toss to combine.</li>
<li>While the radishes cook, in a bowl, combine the remaining lemon juice, mint (roughly chop before adding), 1/2 the green tops of the scallions and 3 tbsp of olive oil; season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>On a serving plate, spread the labneh in a large circular shape. Top with the bulgur, radishes and chicken; drivzle with as much of the herb vinaigrette as you&#39;d like. Garnish with the remaining green tops of the scallions. Bon appetit!</li>
