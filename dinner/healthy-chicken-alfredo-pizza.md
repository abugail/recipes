### Ingredients

* 1 batch [whole wheat pizza dough](egfawe)
* 4 cups [creamy cauliflower sauce] (dff)
* 2 large chicken breasts (shredded)
* 1 cup shredded Mozzarella
* diced tomatoes
* fresh parsley (minced)
* Parmesan cheese
* salt and pepper
* olive oil

> **Pro Tip:** Wait until the edges of chicken start to brown and the outer crust is a little more crispy

### Cooking Instructions

1. Prepare the crust. The recipe linked makes about 2 12-inch round pizzas.
2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
3. Divide the sauce between the two pizzas, spreading about 1½ cups over each unbaked crust.
4. Arrange the chicken evenly over both pizzas and top with a little bit more sauce (about ½ cup each).
5. Add the diced tomatoes or any additional toppings. 
6. Sprinkle cheese over the two pizzas, about ½ cup for each pizza.
7. Bake for 12 minutes.
8. Turn on the broiler and continue baking for an additional 3-8 minutes, depending on how browned you want the top/crust to be. 
9. Serve immediately topped with parsley, additional salt and pepper, Parmesan cheese, or a drizzle of olive oil.
