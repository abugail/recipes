#### Ingredients

* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp fish sauce
* 3 tbsp low sodium soy sauce
* 5 cloves garlic (minced)
* 2 slices of large red onion
* 1 large red pepper
* 4 tiny sweet thai chilies (seeds and stems removed)
* handful of green onion (chopped)
* 40g fresh basil (1 cup)
* 1 cup brown jasmine rice
* 4 large eggs
* 1lb fresh ground chicken

> **Pro Tip:** Thaw ground chicken first if frozen but ensure you cook paste in step 1 below in pan prior to cooking chicken in skillet.


#### Cooking Instructions

1. Use a morter or mini-chopper to grind together the **garlic**, **chilies**, and **red onion** until you get a coarse paste.
2. In a skillet, heat up the **olive oil** over medium-high heat. Add the **paste** to it and fry until fragrant.
3. If using a rice cooker, begin to cook rice.
4. Add the *chicken* to the skillet and break it up with the spatula into small pieces.
5. Add the **fish sauce**, **soy sauce**, **pepper**, and **green onion** *(do not add the basil leaves or they will wilt too much)*.
6. Once the meat is cooked through, check the amount of liquid in the skillet. If itâ€™s too dry, add a little bit of water or sodium-free broth.
7. In a seperate pan begin to cook the **eggs** sunny side up with dearing hot olive oil and then place a lid over the pan for the last minute to create a thin layer of cooked egg on the top.
8. Before taking the skillet with the chicken off the heat, add the **basil** leaves to the mixture and give it a couple of stirs. We only want to wilt the basil with the residual heat that is still in the pan so as not to mute the fragrance of the fresh basil leaves.
9. Serve over rice topped with a Thai style fried egg
