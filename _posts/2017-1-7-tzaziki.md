### Ingredients

* ½ English cucumber, peeled
* 16 oz (2 cups) Cold plain Greek yogurt (either full fat or fat free will work)
* 4 cloves garlic, pressed
* ⅓ cup chopped dill, fresh or frozen
* 1½ Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice (Juice of ½ lemon; please squeeze a real lemon)
* ½ tsp salt, or to taste
* ⅛ tsp black pepper

> **Pro Tip:** You can squeezed the cucumber really tight by the fistful in order to get rid of excess juices

### Cooking Instructions

1. Peel and finely dice *cucumber* and strain of it's juices
2. Combine the strained and chopped cucumber with remaining ingredients
3. Refrigerate for about 1 hour before serving to let the flavors meld. It tastes even better when refrigerated overnight!
