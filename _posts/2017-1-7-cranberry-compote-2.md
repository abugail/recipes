### Ingredients

* ½ pound fresh cranberries, rinsed
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup fresh orange juice
* 3 tbs fresh lemon juice
* 1 tbs grated orange zest
* 1 tsp grated lemon zest
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract

### Cooking Instructions

1. In a medium, non-reactive saucepan bring the cranberries, sugar, orange and lemon juices, orange and lemon zests, vanilla and 1½ cups of the water to a boil.
2.  Cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved and the cranberries begin to pop, about 8 minutes.
4. In a small bowl dissolve the cornstarch in ½ cup of the water and stir into the cranberries.
5. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and stir constantly until the mixture thickens, about 2 minutes.
6. Remove from the heat and cool completely before serving.
