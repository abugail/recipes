### Ingredients

* Two 1lb pieces of pork tenderloin
* 1lb bacon
* 1 bunch of fresh sage (about 10-12 leaves)

> **Pro Tip:** You can also substitute bacon for prosciutto.

### Cooking Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F
2. Arrange the bacon pieces on your work surface, overlapping them.
3. Place both tenderloin logs on the bacon as shown below *(matching one tenderloin’s tapered end with the other’s thicker end)*.
4. Roll the bacon pieces all around the tenderloins and place the bacon-wrapped tenderloins in a baking dish, seam side down.
5. Stick 10-12 fresh sage leaves into the bacon pieces *(as shown below)*.
6. Bake the pork, **uncovered**, at 400°F for about 45-50 minutes.
7. When done, the bacon should be somewhat crispy and the tenderloins inside perfectly cooked at an internal temp of 160 °F.
8. Let it rest, uncovered, for about 10-15 minutes. Then slice and serve with pan juices.
