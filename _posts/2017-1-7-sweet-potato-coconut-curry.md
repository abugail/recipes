### Cooking Instructions

1. Heat ½ tbsp **coconut oil** on medium/high heat and cook the **carrots** for about 3 minutes, until they just begin to soften.
2. Turn the heat down to medium and add in the **pepper**, **broccoli**, **onion** and **ginger** and cook until they begin to soften and brown, about 5 minutes.
3. Add in the ½ tbsp of **yellow curry powder** and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
4. Add in the can of **coconut milk** (make sure you mix it well before adding!) and a pinch of **salt**, mixing well.
5. Raise the heat to medium/high and bring the mixture to a boil.
6. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium/low heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce begins to thicken.
7. While the sauce cooks, heat the remaining **coconut oil** in a separate pan over medium heat.
8. Spiralize the **sweet potato** using the 3 mm blade and then add it into the pan.
9. Cook the noodles, stirring often, until they just begin to wilt, about 10 minutes. Season with salt.
10. While you wait, toss together the diced **mango**, **red onion**, **Thai chili**, **apple cider vinegar** and **cilantro** in a medium bowl. Season with a pinch of salt.
11. Divide the noodles between two plates and top with the curry. 
12. Garnish with the mango salsa and extra cilantro.
