### Ingredients

* 3 cups mushrooms, thinly sliced (cremini if possible)
* 1 tbs butter
* 2 tsp fresh rosemary, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, chopped
* 4-6 oz chicken breasts, boneless skinless
* 1 can light coconut milk
* 1 tbs butter
* 1 tbs gluten-free all purpose flour (use regular flour if not gluten free)
* Optional salt & pepper (to taste)

> **Pro Tip:** Can serve over rice, egg noodles, or with side-dishes

### Cooking Instructions

1. Using a large skillet, heat to medium/high heat on the stove
2. Melt the 1 Tbsp of butter, and add the sliced mushrooms, spreading around the pan evenly to brown
3. Once mushrooms browned on one side, add in the chopped rosemary
4. In the last few minutes of cooking, add the chopped garlic
5. Season with salt & pepper if using
6. Remove the mushrooms from pan and set aside
7. In the same pan (don't clean it!), add in the chicken breasts (season lightly with salt & pepper if using) and brown on both sides (about 5 min each side)
8. Remove chicken breasts from pan and set aside on a plate (They won't be cooked through yet, that's ok)
9. In the same pan, add the other 1 Tbs of butter, and 1 Tbs of flour and whisk it together to make a paste
10. Cook the butter and flour together for about 20 seconds on medium/high heat
11. Slowly add the can of coconut milk, while still whisking
12. Once it's the consistency of a sauce that's thickened, add back the mushrooms and chicken breasts
13. Allow it all to simmer together on low/medium heat for another 6-7 minutes flipping the chicken occasionally until the chicken breasts are cooked through
14. Serve with extra sauce poured on each serving
