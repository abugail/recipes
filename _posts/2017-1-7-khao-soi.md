3. Add the chicken and cook 1 to 2 minutes, tossing now and then to brown it evenly and mix it with the curry paste.
4. Add the coconut milk, chicken broth, turmeric, soy sauce, sugar and salt and stir well.
5. Bring to a gentle boil and adjust heat to maintain a lively simmer.
6. Cook about 10 minutes until chicken is cooked through.
7. Stir in lime juice, remove from heat and cover to keep curry warm while you prepare the noodles.
8. Cook the noodles in a large pot of rapidly boiling water until tender but still firm, as little as 2 minutes for fresh noodles and 7 minutes or more for dried.
9. Drain, rinse well in cold water, drain again and divide the noodles among individual serving bowls.
10. Ladle on hot curry, and sprinkle each serving with the shallots, cilantro and green onions.
11. Serve hot and garnish with crunchy noodle nests if using.
