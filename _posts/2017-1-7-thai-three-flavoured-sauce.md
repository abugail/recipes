### Ingredients

* 40 g red chilies (about 20 bird’s eye chilies or 3 large red jalapeño peppers), finely chopped
* 10 large cloves peeled garlic (finely chopped)
* 2 large shallots (peeled, and finely chopped)
* ½ cup packed cilantro roots or stems *about 20g pulsed to a coarse paste in a food processor*
* 1 cup packed palm sugar (chopped)
* ½ cup water
* ⅓ cup packed brown sugar
* ⅓ cup fish sauce
* ⅓ cup [tamarind pulp](https://github.com/abugail/recipes/blob/master/random/tamarind-pulp.md)
* 2 tablespoons olive oil

> **Pro Tip:** This sauce freezes and thaws beautifully.

### Cooking Instructions

1. In a medium saucepan, fry the garlic-shallot-cilantro-chili paste in the vegetable oil over medium-high heat just until fragrant.
2. Add the remaining ingredients to the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, lower the heat to maintain a simmer.
3. Reduce the sauce down to about 1½ cups; remove from heat. The sauce will thicken up slightly upon cooling.
4. Store the cooled sauce in a glass jar and refrigerate or freeze.
