### Ingredients

* 5-6 medium Gala Apples (or a comparable sweet apple)
* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons rice flour (or 50% rice flour and 50% all-purpose flour for heartier crust)
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup unsweetened dried coconut
* 3/4 cup clear limestone solution or 3/4 cup water with 1.5 teaspoons baking soda mixed in
* 1.5 teaspoons salt
* 1 tablespoon of untoasted white sesame seeds
* About 4 cups of mild vegetable oil for frying

> **Pro Tip:** Use rice flour that comes from long grain rice.

### Cooking Instructions

1. Peel core and slice apples in 1/4-inch thick rings
2. Whisk together the rest of the ingredients, except the oil.
3. In a medium frying pan or heavy-bottomed pot, heat up the oil to about 350° F. Keep the temperature steady.
4. Put the apple slices into the batter. Pick up one slice at a time, making sure it’s thoroughly coated with the batter, and carefully lower it into the hot oil.
> Don’t fry too many slices at the same time as it will cause the oil temperature to drop too low resulting in soggy, oily fried bananas.
5. Flip the apple pieces as necessary to achieve even browning.
6. Once the apple slices are golden brown, remove them to a plate lined with a piece of paper towel.
7. Serve immediately.
