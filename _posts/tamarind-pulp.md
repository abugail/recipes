### Ingredients

* 14-ounce block of shelled tamarinds (see picture below)
* 1 3/4 cups of water (14oz)

> **Pro Tip:**  It’s more economical to make your own tamarind pulp. When you buy the watery prepared tamarind pulp that comes in a plastic tub, you get mostly water and frustratingly small amounts of tamarind for your money.

>Use one ounce of shelled tamarinds per one fluid ounce of water.

>If you plan to use a lot of prepared tamarind pulp in a week or two, you can store it in a glass jar in the refrigerator. For longer storage, I recommend that you freeze it as prepared tamarind pulp can get moldy after a couple of weeks in the refrigerator. If you have ice trays, fill them with the tamarind pulp, freeze, pop out the frozen cubes and store them in a freezer bag in the freezer. That way you can thaw out just a few cubes when you only need a small amount.

### Cooking Instructions

1. Let tamarind block soak for 15-20 minutes.
2. Grab a handful of tamarind pods and keep squashing and squeezing the now-softened pulp to separate it from the veins, the seeds, and the tough membranes that cover the seeds.
3. Run the tamarind pulp purée through a sieve to separate out the pulp.
4. Keep doing this until you end up with nothing but thick and smooth tamarind pulp in the bowl. (as in picture above)
