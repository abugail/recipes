### Ingredients - For the Corn

*3 corn on the cobs, husks on
*2 tbs butter, softened
*½ tbs fresh lime juice
*½ tbs grated parmesan cheese
*¼ tsp salt
*¼ tsp chipotle chili powder, or chili powder

### Ingredients - For the Crema Sauce

*3 tbs mayonnaise
*3 tsp mexican crema, or sour cream
*1 tbs fresh lime juice
*1 tsp salt
*2 tbs fresh cilantro, finely chopped
*½ cup queso cotija, crumbled (can use feta cheese if queso cotija is not available)
*½ teaspoon chipotle chili powder, or chili powder

> **Pro Tip:** Make extra crema

### Cooking Instructions

1. In a large bowl, soak the ears of corn (husks on) for 30 minutes.
2. Using a small bowl, combine the softened butter, lime juice, Parmesan cheese, salt and chipotle powder. 
3. Stir until well combined.
4. Preheat grill to medium heat.
5. Carefully pull the husks back from the corn, but do not entirely remove husks. Remove silk from corn.
6. Rub the butter mixture evenly across the corn. Pull the husks back into place and tie closed with string.
7. Grill the corn for 17-20 minutes, turning frequently to prevent burning.
8. Meanwhile, make the Crema Sauce by stirring together the mayonnaise, crema, lime juice, salt and cilantro.
9. Remove corn from grill and allow ears to cool slightly.
10. Pull husks back and discard. Drizzle Crema Sauce across the corn; sprinkle queso cotija and chipotle powder across the tops of corn before serving.
