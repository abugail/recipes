### Ingredients

* 1¼ cup white flour
* 2¼ teaspoon yeast
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons oil
* 1 cup warm water (not boiling hot, but warm)
* 1⅓ cup whole wheat flour

> **Pro Tip:** Roll the dough out a bit thinner for a crunchier pizza.

### Cooking Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2. Combine the **white flour, yeast,** and **salt** in a large mixing bowl.
3. Add the **oil** and **warm water** to the mixture and combine with an electric mixer. 
4. Mix on high speed for several minutes until a soft, elastic dough forms.
5. Stir in the **whole wheat flour** gradually, by hand.
6. When it's all incorporated, you should be able to easily pick up the dough and knead it gently until you get a soft dough ball.
7. Set aside in a warm place and cover with plastic wrap or even just a dish towel. Let the dough rise for about 10-15 minutes.
8. Roll out the dough into two 12-inch circles. Poke with forks to prevent bubbling *(optional)*. 
9. Place on a pizza stone.
10. Add toppings and then bake for about 12-15 minutes
