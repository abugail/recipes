### Ingredients

* 2 cups macaroni
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1 small yellow onion (cut the onion into thin rings)
* 1 small butternut squash (4-5 cups cubed)
* 5 cups chicken or vegetable broth
* ¾ cup milk
* 1 tsp salt
* ⅔ cup shredded cheese *(Gruyère recomended but any kind will work)*
* parsley for topping
* salt and pepper to taste

> **Pro Tip:** Can be made gluten free with gf pasta.

>When caramelizing the onions, keep the heat low to prevent burning. The deeper the golden color, the more flavorful they will be.

### Cooking Instructions

1. Cook **macaroni**, drain and set aside. 
2. Heat **butter** in a large skillet over medium low heat. 
3. Add **onion** to the butter in the pan. Saute over low heat until fragrant and golden, about 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, remove the skin and the seeds from the **squash**. Cut the flesh into small cubes. 
5. Bring the **broth** to a boil and add the squash. Cook for 5-7 minutes or until fork tender. 
6. Drain, reserving ½ cup broth, and transfer squash to the blender. 
7. Add the onions, **milk**, **salt**, and reserved broth and puree until completely smooth and creamy. This should yield about 4 cups sauce.
8. Pour the pureed sauce over the cooked noodles and add the **shredded cheese**.
9. Stir to melt the cheese; add water or milk to adjust consistency as needed. 
10. Serve with **parsley**, salt, and pepper to taste.
