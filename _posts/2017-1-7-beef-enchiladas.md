### Ingredients

* 12 corn tortillas
* 4 steak cutlets, seasoned with chili powder and black pepper, then baked in foil until done (about 1 hour)
* 3 cups shredded cheese (half Monterey Jack and half cheddar); divided use
* [Ranchero sauce](https://github.com/abugail/recipes/blob/master/sauces/ranchero-sauce.md)

> **Pro Tip:** this is a special instruction

### Cooking Instructions

1. Spray each tortilla with plive oil and heat lightly in skillet (spraying helps prevent sogginess).
2. Stack on a plate and keep covered until ready to fill.
3. Layer in beef strips (or shredded beef or ground beef), along with the chunky sauce pieces (use a slotted spoon), and a sprinkling of shredded cheeses.
4. Roll up each tortilla and add to the baking dish, packing in tightly.
5. Pour remaining sauce over tops and around sides.
6. Sprinkle remaining cheese on top.
7. Bake about 30-40 minutes in a 350-degree oven or until top is bubbly and browning.
8. Serve immediately with sides and freeze remainder if desired.
