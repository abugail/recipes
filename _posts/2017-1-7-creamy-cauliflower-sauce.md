### Ingredients

* 8 large cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 5-6 cups cauliflower florets
* 6-7 cups vegetable broth or water
* 1 teaspoon salt (more to taste)
* ½ teaspoon pepper (more to taste)
* ½ cup milk (more to taste)

> **Pro Tip:** If the sauce starts to look dry, add a few drops of water, milk, or olive oil.

### Cooking Instructions

1. **Garlic:** Saute the minced garlic with the butter in a large nonstick skillet over low heat. 
2. Cook for several minutes or until the garlic is soft and fragrant but not browned. Remove from heat and set aside.
3. **Cauliflower:** Bring the water or vegetable broth to a boil in a large pot. Add the cauliflower and cook, covered, for 7-10 minutes or until cauliflower is fork tender. Do not drain.
4. **Puree:** Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cauliflower pieces to the blender. 
5. Add 1 cup vegetable broth or cooking liquid, sauteed garlic/butter, salt, pepper, and milk.
6. Blend or puree for several minutes until the sauce is very smooth, adding more broth or milk depending on how thick you want the sauce.
7. *You may have to do this in batches depending on the size of your blender.*
