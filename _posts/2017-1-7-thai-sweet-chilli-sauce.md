### Ingredients

* 3 Large garlic cloves (peeled)
* 2 red Jalapeño or Serrano peppers (deseeded)
* ¼ cup white distilled vinegar
* ½ cup sugar
* ¾ cup water
* ½ tablespoon salt
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch or potato starch
* 2 tablespoons water

> **Pro Tip:** The heat is mostly in the veins and seeds of chilli peppers. Customize your sweet chilli sauce according to your heat tolerance.

>This sauce will keep for us to two weeks in the refrigerator.

### Cooking Instructions

1. In the blender, purée together all the ingredients, except for the *cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of water*.
2. Transfer the mixture to a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
3. Lower the heat to medium and simmer until the mixture thickens up a bit and the garlic-pepper bits begin to soften *(about 3 minutes)*.
4. Combine the cornstarch and water to make a slurry. 
5. Whisk in the cornstarch mixture and continue to simmer one more minute. 
6. *The cornstarch will help the sauce to thicken slightly thereby causing nice suspension of the garlic-pepper bits; otherwise, you get a thin sauce with all the little pieces floating on the surface.*
7. Let cool completely before storing in a glass jar and refrigerate.
