###Ingredients

**Marinade Sauce Ingredients**
* 2-3 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into 1” pieces)
* ½ cup soy sauce
* ½ cup Chinese rice wine (may substitute dry sherry)
* ½ cup water
* 2 tbs toasted sesame seed oil
* 1-3 tsp Sriracha/Asian hot chili sauce
* ½ tsp salt
* 5 garlic cloves (minced)
* 3 tbs freshly grated ginger
* Dash of pepper
* 2 tsp cornstarch (reserve from marinade)

**Caramel Sauce Ingredients**
* 1 cup sugar
* ¼ cup water

**Flour Breading Ingredients**
* 1 cup flour
* ½ tsp black pepper
* ¼ tsp cayenne pepper
* 2 tbs ground ginger (sounds like a lot, its amazing)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 2 eggs + 2 tbs water whisked together

**Snow peas, or other vegetables of choice**


### Cooking Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk all of the **marinade ingredients** together **except for the cornstarch**.
2. Spoon ¼ cup plus 2 tbs of the marinade into a freezer bag with the chicken; refrigerate for 30 minutes up to overnight.
3. Refrigerate the remaining marinade ingredients separately in the bowl (this will become the base of your sauce).
4. When ready to cook, place aluminum foil on the bottom of a baking sheet. 
5. Add cooking rack on top and spray with cooking spray. 
6. Combine the **flour breading ingredients** in a large freezer bag. 
7. Dip the chicken pieces in the egg wash and then place them in the flour mixture.
8. Shake until evenly coated.
9. Place chicken on baking sheet and lightly spray tops of chicken with cooking spray.
10. Bake at 375 degrees for 10 minutes
11. Move the baking tray to the top middle oven rack and broil until crispy, watching closely so the chicken doesn't burn (about 2-3 minutes).
12. Flip chicken pieces over and broil another 2-3 minutes, or until golden and crispy.

13. While the chicken is baking, whisk 2 tbs **cornstarch** to the reserved sauce. Set aside.
14. Add **water** and **sugar** to large skillet and boil over medium heat, for 1 minute - don't overcook or it will harden!
15. At this point, **add reserved sauce** all at once to the hot caramel.
16. Simmer the sauce until it thickens, about 1-2 minutes. 
17. Add snow peas and simmer 30 more seconds. *If adding different vegetables, simmer for 1-2 minutes, or until vegetables are crisp tender and then add snow peas.*
