### Ingredients

* 2 sticks unsalted butter
* 1 cup Crisco shortening
* 1 Tbs clear vanilla extract
* 1 2lb bag of Domino powdered sugar
* 4-8 Tbs milk

> **Pro Tip:** Let your butter sit out for awhile to soften. DO NOT put it in the microwave. If you do not have time, cut the butter up in small chunks.

### Cooking Instructions

1. Beat the butter until soft and creamy in your mixer. 
2. Add in shortening, beat again. I like to give mine a few minutes on medium high...beating it a little longer makes it lighter.
3. Add vanilla and mix well.
4. Add in the powdered sugar about a cup at a time.
5. Add in milk 1 Tbs at a time until you've got your desired consistency.
