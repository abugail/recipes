### Ingredients

* 1 box white cake mix, plus ingredients to prepare cake
* 1 box brownie mix (9x13" pan size), plus ingredients to prepare brownies
* 2 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, broken into pieces
* 7 ounces sweetened condensed milk (half of a 14-ounce can)
* 1, 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature
* ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 4 cups powdered sugar
* ¼ cup milk

> **Pro Tip:** You can make the white cake rounds the night before you want to assemble the cake

### Cooking Instructions

1. Prepare white **cake mix** according to package directions
2. Bake in two 9-inch round pans as directed, cool completely
3. On the day you want to assemble the cake, prepare **brownie mix** according to package directions
4. Line a 9-inch round cake pan with foil and spray with cooking spray
5. Pour brownie batter into pan, making sure it doesn't go more than 3/4 of the way up the pan (Poster brownie mix was a regular 9x13" pan size - about an 18 ounce package - and I used all of it. If the brownie mix makes more for some reason, you can bake it in cupcake liners or discard any extra.)
6. Bake for 20-30 minutes, until a toothpick comes out with just a few crumbs about 1" from the side of the pan
7. Let the brownie layer cool about 30-45 minutes, then gently remove it from the pan using the foil.
8. Place **semi-sweet chocolate** and **sweetened condensed milk** in a small bowl
9. Microwave in 30 second increments, stirring between each, until smooth-Let sit 5 minutes
10. Remove foil from brownies and place on cake stand
11. Pour chocolate sauce all over the top of the brownies (some may spill over the sides, that's okay.)
12. Let finish cooling to room temperature
13. Make the **frosting** by beating the **butter**, **cream cheese**, and **vanilla** in stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment for about 1-2 minutes, until smooth
14. Add the **powdered sugar**, 1 cup at at time, until frosting is light and creamy
15. Add **milk**, 1 tbs at a time, until you reach your desired spreading consistency (Poster used 1 tbs).
16. Once brownie layer has cooled, place one white cake layer on top of the brownie layer
17. Add a thin layer of frosting on top, then top with second white cake layer
18. Give the entire cake a very thin layer of frosting (this is your crumb coat, so that your final coat won't be full of crumbs) 
19. Chill the cake until the frosting is set, then use remaining frosting to coat the cake
20. Use your spatula to make a "c" pattern over the cake for the vintage look
21. Store cake loosely covered in refrigerator.
