*1 onion, diced

*¼ cup flour
*3.5 cups chicken stock

### Cooking Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees
2. Lay your pie crust out on the counter and slice it into circles using a drinking glass

5. Heat some olive oil in a large soup pan over medium high heat
6. When hot, add your carrots, onions, and garlic
7. Saute until the onions are translucent
8. Add in your butter and let that melt
9. Stir in your flour
10. Let cook for about 30 seconds, stirring constantly
11. Pour in your chicken stock and milk
13. Add in your parsley, red pepper flakes, and nutmeg
14. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer
15. Simmer until thickened
16. Add your chicken, peas, and corn
17. Bring back to a simmer and cook until the frozen peas and corn are heated through
18. If your soup gets too thick, add a little bit of milk and stir to combine
19. Top your bowls of soup with a pie crust disk and you are ready to go!
